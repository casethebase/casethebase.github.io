                    <p>Hello World! My name is Casey, and this is the beginning of my portfolio. While this isn't the beginning of my story, it's a good place to start. A little bit about my background might also help:</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>I play accordion! At least, I did. Started at age 5 on that one. Then a guitar looked cool, so I picked that one up too. Piano, same story. Then... Suddenly... out of nowhere...
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>....BAM....</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>My high school choir recruited me to join them. So I joined them! And boy it's been a ride ever since. Long story short, I liked it, and decided I wanted to go to college for Music Education. Voice was my primary instrument! (Would have chosen mayonaisse but they weren't ready for it unfortunately)</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>From there, it gets complicated -- because while I enjoyed using my voice and training myself to be a classical singer, I had forgotten that I also really liked computers. I thought maybe, it might make a nice change of pace to start learning about them again. After all, as we all know, our parents tell us we can be anything when we grow up, don't they? At that point I gave it some thought, and after a long night of brainstorming, I made a decision...</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>I decided to become a computer!</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>It got really busy after that, I didn't realize computers worked so hard. I eventually took a free classes on how to speak computer. It was hard at first to be a computer, but I eventually learned some basics about how to keep one alive, change out it's parts, and problem solve. Wasn't long after that that I found myself working in Information Technology (IT) for short, as a helpdesk engineer. And that's where I am now.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>As a computer, I have dreams! I dream of working on privacy, on automation, on AI, and making really cool-looking things. Above all I like the idea of an environment that fosters curiosity. Building things, problem solving, and pursuing mastery.
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>This is the place where I'm investing into that mastery, and hopefully taking a large step forward. Thanks for reading! Hope you'll say hi sometime \(^.^;)
